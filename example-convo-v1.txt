1. My urination has been seen yellow in color and appears to be more frequent to a level I can notice it. I am concerned.


2. I don't really drink more water compared to before. I only drink about 2 to 3 regular plastic water bottle volume of water. 


3. I have not increased it but it has always been about two sweetened lemon tea by pure leaf everyday.


4. I don't really keep track of the sugar intake so it is kind of random. I have no preference.


5. No change in activity. and no known diseases except depression.
